Orchestra Platform Bundle for Laravel
==============

Provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build. 
Orchestra Platform is what Bonfire is for CodeIgniter.

This repository is an only used for Laravel 3. Please refer to [Orchestra Platform 2](https://github.com/orchestral/platform) to use it with Laravel 4.

In the `application/bundles.php` file, add the following entries:

	'orchestra' => array('auto' => true, 'handles' => 'orchestra'),

> **Note on Orchestra**, you can change `handles` value to anything unique, such as `admin` for example.

#### Publish Bundle Asset

Before running the Setup instruction, run the following from Artisan to publish all related assets for Orchestra Platform:

	php artisan bundle:publish

## Setup

Now navigate to your Orchestra Platform handles URL in a web browser, you should see an installation page. Do remember to change the URL if you use a different handles value.

Please ensure that your configuration is correct, Orchestra Platform will utilize configuration from `application/config` folder to make the process stream-less with your other application (or bundles).

- Create a `User` model, which extends `Orchestra\Model\User` model.
- Update `application/config/database.php` and ensure your database connection is properly set up.
- Update `application/config/auth.php`.
	- Orchestra only supports Eloquent auth driver at the moment.
	- Select your `User` model, or change it to `Orchestra\Model\User`.
